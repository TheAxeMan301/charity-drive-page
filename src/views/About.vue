          <p class="faq-answer">
            The plan is to start at 8 AM PST on Saturday May 4 from the Petaluma, CA Tesla
            Supercharger station and drive straight through to Salt Lake City, UT with a

            I'm new, who are dwangoAC and TASBot?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            TASBot is best described as an individual who holds replay devices and participates
            in his favorite pastime of playing video games on real hardware. TASBot is in the
            care of his creator and longtime keeper, dwangoAC.
            dwangoAC is the President of the North Bay Linux Users' Group as well as a YouTube
            and Twitch Partner who streams TASBot content on a regular basis.
            TheAxeMan is a long-time TAS author making his first marathon appearance, showing
            off his run of Final Fantasy at RPG Limit Break. You can find the tasbot crew on

          <h3 class="faq-question">
            Who came up with this crazy idea?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            The idea was hatched by dwangoAC and was originally planned to be a stunt as part
            of a Desert Bus for HOPE fundraiser (see more, below). This is a new concept and
            these ideas may be too crazy but we won't know until we try.
          </p>
          <h3 class="faq-question">
            What about safety?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            The Crowd Control incentives will have safety limits built in. Changes to max
            speed will only be made while the vehicle is parked and will not allow any unsafe
            speeds at any time. All donation incentives and effects that can be triggered
            using Crowd Control all have limits in place to ensure safety. If for any reason
            there is a concern about the health and safety of anyone we reserve the right to
            cancel an effect or modify it. Raising money for a good cause is our second highest
            priority behind safety.
          </p>
          <h3 class="faq-question">
            How is this related to speedrunning?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            The remote Tesla controls come from Crowd Control which is primarily focused on
            gaming and speedrunning. TASBot, while not speedrunning any game, will also be
            in the car along for the ride. TheAxeMan is also looking forward to performing some
            speedrunning along the way and dwangoAC may even try to do some LttP rando.

          <h3 class="faq-question">
            What is Twitch and what are bits and subscriptions?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Twitch is an online video and streaming service from Amazon that has a focus on
            live, streaming content (whereas YouTube has a focus on prerecorded content). Twitch
            allows streamers (content creators who use the platform to broadcast live video) to
            receive money through what they call Subscriptions, a roughly $5 a month subscription
            with the revenue split between the streamer and Twitch / Amazon. In addition, Twitch has
            what are called "bits" which can be purchased and used to cheer streamers on or engage
            with them in various other ways. Bits are not a monetary instrument but represent,
            effectively, 1 cent per bit when given to a streamer. For the purposes of this event,
            dwangoAC will be donating his portion of subscriptions as well as all revenue from bits.
          </p>
          <h3 class="faq-question">
            Are you taking personal donations for equipment?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            100% of stream revenue and donations for the day of the event will be donated
            to NAMI. However, the general upkeep of TASBot and equipment for this particular event
            in particular are not cheap. To date dwangoAC has personally spent over $12,000 on
            equipment and travel costs during past events. If you would like to help offset some
            of the expenses for the trip please join us on

            and ask how you can help. We're
            generally relying on donations from within our community to cover expenses for this
            trip to ensure that 100% of all donations the day of the event go directly to charity.

          <h3 class="faq-question">
            Is this the same as Desert Bus for HOPE?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Desert Bus For HOPE was a big inspiration for this event but is a very different
            model, and also a different part of the Nevada desert. Our event is a single day
            and a single one-way trip but with a longer journey (14+ hours instead of 8). This
            event is also very different for one other reason - we're in an actual car, on an
            actual interstate.
